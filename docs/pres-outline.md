## Presentation 

# Introduction (R: Connie)
* Say hi and introduce everyone's name // login as everyone is getting introduced 
* Why we chose this project: wanted something seemingly simple but also challenging so that we could focus on implementing many stretch features (also because I refused to do the quiz app jkjk)

# Main features (R: Connie) 
* Smart To-do list that auto-categorizes your to-dos into watch, eat, read, buy or general categories
* Main sorting algorithm leverages google search & google natural language apis
* Also used other APIs such as google-books, yelp, amazon, imdb, and moviedb for some special features

Demo: 
1) Add a couple of items to the list, then choose 1 of each watch, eat, read, buy to show the details card)
(Do it fast to show off spinner, do the speed round here)
2) Input error (maybe if there's time)

When something gets mis-categorized, hand over to next person for stretch features 
# Stretch Demo (R: Syd)
1) Change the category of the mis-categorized item -> show the new details card
2) Change the name of the item -> show the new details card
3) Complete items -> Toggle the done list
4) Change priority of the item
5) Mobile view

# Future Features V2 (R: Syd)
* Allow users to create their own categories/implement more categories

# UI (R: Sam) Switch to dark mode
* Also no one likes having their eyes burned off -> show-off dark mode (using local storage)
* Everything you'd ever need in a normal to-do's list so kept everything simple from a design standpoint

# Closing Remarks (R: Sam)
* Tricky in the beginning figuring out the workflow (picking things that don't conflict), but once we got going, we were able to accomplish a lot ... like A LOT 
* Had merge conflicts, used pull requests instead, but merging wasn't too bad when we worked togetha
* Finding a good free API one was tough (ones that are reliable and fast)
* Mention Heroku hosting (hashing passwords but mention dont actually used something real)
* Say thank you with confetti
